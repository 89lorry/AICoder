[PROMPT]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analyze the following software requirements and create a high-level architectural design:

Requirements:

I need a contact management system where I can:
- Save people's names, email addresses, and phone numbers
- Search for contacts by name
- See all my contacts in alphabetical order
- Remove contacts I don't need anymore

Make sure emails and phone numbers are valid before saving them.


🚨 ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT 🚨
- EXACTLY 3 components. NO MORE, NO LESS.
- If you suggest 4+ components, the system WILL FAIL.
- Keep it SIMPLE - merge related functionality into single components.
- Avoid over-engineering at ALL costs.
- Focus ONLY on core requirements.

Provide a JSON response with:
1. "components": List of EXACTLY 3 main components/modules
2. "dependencies": List of external dependencies (libraries, frameworks)
3. "architecture_type": Type of architecture (CLI, API, GUI, etc.)
4. "complexity": Estimated complexity level (simple, medium, complex)
5. "summary": Brief summary of what the software should do

Remember: EXACTLY 3 components. This is MANDATORY for system success.
